# Stats101AProject

This project was done for my UCLA Stats 101A class (Introduction to Data Analysis and Regression). It involved analyzing which factors most played into one's happiness level. It consisted primarily of data cleaning and simple linear model analysis, with necessary variable transformations to create the most accurate model.
